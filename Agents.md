- When writing code for website development, use the Context7 MCP service whenever you are uncertain about implementation details or need up-to-date documentation.
- When making changes to the website’s interface, layout, or any display-related aspects, always follow the Professional style guidelines.
- When tasks involve Cloudflare services (including Workers, Pages, KV, R2, D1, or related configurations), use the corresponding Cloudflare MCP service. Do not rely on assumptions about Cloudflare APIs or platform behavior.
